# FlagDetection

- Problem 1: tell the name of the country for a flag given?

The app you will build shall take an image of a national flag and return the name of the country to which this flag belongs to. Use Wikipedia for reference flags (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign_state_flags.
You can assume that the flag image is transformed by projective transform only, however, there can be some color/focus/brightness perturbation.

To fasten the database creation, you can use wikipedia Python package (https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/).

- Problem 2: This extends the Problem 1. (TODO)

To show if there are some flag clusters, do your best to visualize the space of flags in 2D.
Moreover, analyze and tell if there is any relationship between flag colors and continent (consider only basic colors, like red, green, blue, yellow, black, and white).
